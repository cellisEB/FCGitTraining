In the VSCode project, open a terminal and checkout that commit "git checkout {paste commit hash}"

Once you've checked out that commit, it will give you instructions on how to create a new branch from that commit. Name your branch "{yourname_branch}"

Update the HTML file called "FCTraining" to hold your information. Save and commit (using the command line).

Push your branch
  *Hint: it should give you an error because you need to create a remote

In Github, you'll see your new branch. Create a Pull Request to merge your branch into main.
  *If it doesn't tell you that you have a merge conflict-- send me a message (:
